BuddyPress Multilingual allows BuddyPress sites to run fully multilingual using the WPML plugin.

== Description ==

The plugin allows visitors to choose their language. It makes all the BuddyPress elements multilingual including the main site and all guest sites.

Guest blogs can choose their language and create multilingual contents. Additionally, each guest can choose the admin language individually.

This plugin requires [WPML](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/sitepress-multilingual-cms/). It uses WPML's language API and hooks to BuddyPress to make it multilingual.

Currently working with BuddyPress 1.0.3, but we're looking forward to adapt it to BuddyPress 1.1.
